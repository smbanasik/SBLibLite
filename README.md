# SBLibLite

A counterpart to SBLib, with a focus on proof-of-concept for containers and algorithms.
Meant to be smaller in scope.

## Usage
Download the header files that you wish to use and `#include` them in your project.

## Still Planned

- Testing of the circular queue
- A set of functions for bit manipulation
- An array linked list hybrid (a linked list of arrays that are X elements long)
- A small vector optimization implementation (first X elements are on the stack)
- Pool datatype (contiguous storage that doesn't invalidate references)
- Lazy pointers? (deep copy only when data is modified)
  - Would have to keep track of which pointers rely on which data being modified
